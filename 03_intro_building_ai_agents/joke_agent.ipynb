    "# Introduction: Building AI Agents from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are behind today’s most powerful applications — from chat assistants to automated reasoning systems. Instead of relying on black‑box frameworks, this tutorial shows you how to **build agents step by step**, so you understand *how* they think, reason, and act.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll use Python, Pydantic, and the Outlines library to give a model structure, logic, and tool‑use abilities. By coding agents directly, you’ll see how large language models interpret instructions, perform calculations, and stay consistent through structured generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to build agents from scratch helps you:\n",
    "- **Control your outputs.** Structured schemas ensure that models return predictable, machine‑readable data.  \n",
    "- **Add real reasoning.** Multi‑step loops let the model “think” before answering.  \n",
    "- **Integrate tools for accuracy.** Combine the creativity of a language model with the precision of code utilities like calculators or converters.  \n",
    "- **Debug and trust behavior.** Watching an agent reason in steps makes its logic transparent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What You’ll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Generation:** A reliable dad joke generator that outputs valid JSON.  \n",
    "2. **Math Dad Joke Agent:** A reasoning‑enabled version that checks its math with a calculator tool.  \n",
    "3. **Extension Exercise:** Your own agent: a unit converter joke generator, or even a STEM joke bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you’ll know how to design, guide, and test your own reasoning‑ready AI agents — all built from fundamentals."

    "## Part 1: Understanding Structured Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges when working with large language models (LLMs) is that they typically produce unstructured text—free-form answers that might not follow a consistent or machine-readable format. Structured generation solves this problem by defining a schema (a data structure the model must follow) and constraining the output to match it. This is particularly useful for applications that require reliability and consistency, such as agents, tools, or pipelines that process AI-generated data automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, structured generation is handled through the Pydantic library and the Outlines package, which enforces that the model’s output adheres to a specified structure.  Our demo will walk you through a LLM-joke generator.  Let's start by highlighting some key components of the code demo. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to Model\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "openai_client = OpenAI(\n",
    "    api_key=\"ollama\",\n",
    "    base_url=\"http://localhost:11434/v1\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block connects to a local Ollama instance that supports the OpenAI-compatible API. We’re using the standard OpenAI SDK but pointing it at a local endpoint — in this case, llama3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wrap the Model in Outlines \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = from_openai(openai_client, model_name=\"llama3.2\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The from_openai function from Outlines bridges the OpenAI client and structured output generation. It automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompts the model with JSON constraints.\n",
    "- Validates the response against the Pydantic schema.\n",
    "- Returns only schema-compliant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you never have to write manual parsing code or regex hacks to clean up model responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Pydantic to Define a Schema for Joke Generator \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "class DadJoke(BaseModel):\n",
    "    setup: str = Field(..., description=\"Joke setup\")\n",
    "    punchline: str = Field(..., description=\"Punchline\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, DadJoke defines a simple schema with two string fields — setup and punchline.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BaseModel ensures data validation and type checking.\n",
    "- Field adds helpful descriptions for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this model, we tell the LLM: “You must return valid JSON that fits this schema.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generation Function \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def generate_dad_joke(topic: str):\n",
    "    prompt = f\"Tell a perfect dad joke about {topic}.\"\n",
    "    joke = model(prompt, DadJoke)\n",
    "    return joke\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function defines a natural-language prompt and runs the model, specifying DadJoke as the schema.\n",
    "The call model(prompt, DadJoke) ensures structured output that fits the schema automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now that we have walked through the major highlights of the code, let's start generating jokes! "

    "## Part 2: Building a Math‑Enabled Dad Joke Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we created a simple structured generator that could produce dad jokes with a predictable JSON output. That version gave us reliability and clean data, but it didn’t *think* about the joke — it just produced one in a single shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we’ll take the next step and build a **reasoning‑enabled math-joke agent**. This new version can:\n",
    "- Think through multiple steps before deciding on a punchline.\n",
    "- Use a **calculator tool** to double‑check its math.\n",
    "- Still produce structured, validated output using the same pattern from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces a key concept for agent design: **structured reasoning**. Instead of returning just data, the model communicates its thought process and actions in a controlled schema.  Below we highlight key code differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Expanding the Schema System\n",
    "\n",
    "To support reasoning and tool use, we introduce two new Pydantic models in addition to our original `DadJoke` structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ToolCall(BaseModel):\n",
    "    name: str = Field(\"calculator\", description=\"Use this tool to perform simple arithmetic.\")\n",
    "    x: float = Field(..., description=\"First number\")\n",
    "    y: float = Field(..., description=\"Second number\")\n",
    "    operation: str = Field(..., description=\"Operation: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class AgentAction(BaseModel):\n",
    "    thought: str = Field(..., description=\"Internal reasoning about what to do next.\")\n",
    "    action: Optional[ToolCall] = Field(None, description=\"Tool call if calculation is needed.\")\n",
    "    final_joke: Optional[DadJoke] = Field(None, description=\"Final dad joke when ready.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ToolCall schema defines how the model can request a calculation, while AgentAction acts as the brain of the agent — containing what the model thinks, what action (if any) it wants to take, and finally, the completed joke.  The AgentAction schema is a ReAct style agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful extension of structured generation. Instead of controlling the format of a single response, we’re now structuring the entire reasoning process. Whether the model is thinking, calculating, or concluding, every step follows a defined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Giving the Agent a Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a simple tool for performing arithmetic operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculator_tool(x: float, y: float, operation: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Perform simple math operations including division.\"\"\"\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        if operation == \"add\":\n",
    "            return str(x + y)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the model is generating creative text, arithmetic precision comes from the code — not language prediction. When the model “calls” this tool, our code executes the function, captures the result, and feeds it back as an observation for the next reasoning step. This demonstrates how structured agents blend statistical reasoning (language generation) and symbolic computation (exact math).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Creating an Agent Loop \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we build a reasoning loop that allows the model to think and choose to either call the calculator, interpret results, or make the final joke:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def generate_dad_joke_agent(topic: str, max_steps: int = 3):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    for step in range(max_steps):\n",
    "        response = model(prompt, AgentAction)\n",
    "        if action_obj.action:\n",
    "            result = calculator_tool(...)\n",
    "            observations.append(f\"Calculator result: {result}\")\n",
    "        elif action_obj.final_joke:\n",
    "            return action_obj.final_joke\n",
    "\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration represents one reasoning cycle. The model produces a structured AgentAction, which might include a ToolCall. If it does, our program executes that tool and provides the result as context in the next turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how we move from single‑turn generation to multi‑step reasoning — the agent uses a feedback loop to verify and improve its reasoning before producing the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Prompt Template \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to provide a detailed prompt to the agent instructing it on how to reason and choose appropriate next steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "context = f\"\"\"\n",
    "You are a REASONING‑ENABLED Dad Joke Agent writing a math‑themed joke about the number '{topic}'.\n",
    "...\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now that we have walked through the major code changes, let's take a look at and execute our math-joke-agent generator! "
